# Project-JS-docs
The webpage I submitted to freeCodeCamp for "Project JS Docs".

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks
I did some changes with the "user-stories" section, and ended up with https://green-eyed-teen.github.io/Tech-Docs-Page/

For any suggestions or comments, contact me on my Discord (Scorpius07#7945). Thank you!
